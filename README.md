# AES_CCM_Demo

This demo is based on code from: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/shawnfa/2009/03/17/authenticated-symmetric-encryption-in-net/

You will need the System.Cryptography.dll which is included in /lib from the Microsoft CLR Security team: http://clrsecurity.codeplex.com/

Needless to say 'password' is not a good password.
